# house-price-prediction-using-linear-regression
In this project, I have implemented a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. The goal is to predict the prices of houses based on their features like area, number of rooms, location, etc. Linear Regression is a simple and effective technique for this task as it establishes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house price).

#linear regression
Linear Regression is a popular and widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It is a straightforward and interpretable algorithm commonly used for tasks such as predictive modeling, regression analysis, and trend forecasting.
